This website was generated with the Elstir static site generator, a fork of [MkDocs](https://Mkdocs.org) which uses [Pandoc](https://Pandoc.org) as the backend. The theme uses [Bootstrap]() and is heavily adapted from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). Additional sources of inspiration for the layout of this site include [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), [Pandas](), and [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/). A slightly modified version of [Particle.js]() is used on the home page.
