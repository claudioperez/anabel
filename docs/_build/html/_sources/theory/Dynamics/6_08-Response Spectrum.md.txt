# Response Spectrum Characteristics

## Spectral Regions

### Short Period (Acceleration Sensitive)

A ~ $\ddot{u}_{go}$

### Intermediate (Velocity Sensitive)

V ~ $\dot{u}_{go}$

### Long Period (Displacement Sensitive)

D ~ $u_{go}$

## Near/Far-Fault Effects

|       |Near   |Far    |
|-------|-------|-------|
| $\dot{u}_{go}/\ddot{u}_{go}$|Large | Small|


## Damping

### $T_n$

- As  $T_n -> \infin$ and $T_n -> 0$, damping has little effect.

- The effect of damping is greatest in the Velocity-sensitive spectral region.

### Ground Motion

- The effect of damping is greatest when ground motions are nearly harmonic for many cycles, and the system is near resonnance.
