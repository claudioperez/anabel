4.3.2 Solution Process
assumptions:
1) The applied loading consists only of the reference load $P_{r e f},$ which is increased monotonically by incrementing the load factor $\lambda$ until reaching the collapse load factor $\lambda_{c}$
2) Plastic hinges that are "open" under a load factor $\lambda$ cannot "close" under a higher load factor: this means that plastic hinge deformations increase monotonically under the monotonically increasing reference load.
$$
\boldsymbol{V}_{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}=\mathbf{F}, \boldsymbol{Q}_{c}+\boldsymbol{V}_{0}
$$
The process for the determination of the last hinge to form consists of the following steps:
1) Select any hinge of the collapse mechanism as last to form and solve the kinematic relations for the corresponding free dof displacements $U_{f}^{t}$, where the superseript tr stands for trial result.
2) Determine the plastic hinge deformations $V_{h p}^{\text {tr }}$ corresponding to $U_{f}^{\text {tr }}$ with
    $$
    \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{V}_{\varepsilon}+\boldsymbol{V}_{h p}^{t r}=\mathbf{A}_{f} \boldsymbol{U}_{f}^{t r}
    $$
3) If the sign of each plastic deformation matches the sign of the corresponding basic force $Q_{c}$ from the equilibrium equations, the last hinge location is correct. The trial displacements and plastic deformations from steps (1) and (2) give the free dof displacements $U_{f}$ and the plastic deformations $\boldsymbol{V}_{h p}$ at incipient collapse.

4) If the sign of one or more plastic deformations does not match the sign of the corresponding basic force, correct the free dof displacements and plastic deformations of Step (1) and (2) in a single step as described in the following.

If the sign of one or more plastic deformations does not match the sign of the corresponding basic
