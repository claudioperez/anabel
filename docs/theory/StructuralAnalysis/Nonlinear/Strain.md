# Strain

There are many possible representations of deformation. Any reasonable representation however, must be able to represent a rigid rotation of an unstrained body without producing any strain. The engineering strain fails here, thus it cannot be used for general geometrically nonlinear cases [^1].

## Green-Lagrange

*The classical Lagrangian finite strain measure*[^3]

- We should note that in the definition of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, all derivatives are with respect to the initial coordinates of the material particles. For this reason, we say that the strain tensor is defined with respect to the initial coordinates of the body. Also note that, although only up to quadratic terms of displacement derivatives appear in ( 6.55), this is the complete strain tensor; i.e., we have not neglect~d any higher-order terms [^2].
  
- contains derivatives of the displacements with respect to the original configuration [^1].
- Values represent strains in material directions, similar to the behavior of the Second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. This allows a physical interpretation [^1].
- Even for a uniaxial case, the Green-Lagrange strain is strongly nonlinear with respect to the displacement. If an object is stretched to twice its original length, the Green-Lagrange strain is 1.5 in the stretching direction. If the object is compressed to half its length, the strain would read -0.375 [^1].
