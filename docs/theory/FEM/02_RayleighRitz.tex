\subsection{Rayleigh}\label{rayleigh}}

Brief outline

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume an admissible form of the solution with one unknown parameter
\item
  Apply PVD to obtain the best estimate of the exact (but unknown )
  solution (e.g.~displacement)
\item
  Approximate solution satisfies governing equation (e.g.~equilibrium)
  in an average ( weak) sense.
\end{itemize}

Trial function remarks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The trial functions collectively satisfy the admissibility conditions:
\item
  They satisfy the displacement BC.
\item
  They have enough continuity that the derivatives are defined (although
  the derivatives are not continuous at element boundaries).
\item
  They are linearly independent.
\item
  They are complete as a family of piecewise linear functions over the
  rod.
\end{itemize}
