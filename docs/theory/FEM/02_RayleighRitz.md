## Rayleigh

Brief outline

- Assume an admissible form of the solution with one unknown parameter
- Apply PVD to obtain the best estimate of the exact (but unknown ) solution (e.g. displacement)
- Approximate solution satisfies governing equation (e.g. equilibrium) in an average ( weak) sense.

Trial function remarks:

- The trial functions collectively satisfy the admissibility conditions:
- They satisfy the displacement BC.
- They have enough continuity that the derivatives are defined (although the derivatives are not continuous at element boundaries).
- They are linearly independent.
- They are complete as a family of piecewise linear functions over the rod.
