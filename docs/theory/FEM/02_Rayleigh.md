# 2

A structure is in equilibrium under a system of loads and initial strains if for any
admissible virtual displacement, the internal virtual work equals the external virtual work.

## Weak form

1. Multiply both sides of the DE or PDE by a function
2. The function must be homogeneous (= 0) where displacement BCâ€™s are specified.
3. The function must have sufficient continuity for differentiation.
4. Integrate over the domain, e.g. length of the rod
5. Typically, perform IBP and some manipulations to arrive to the weak form

## Rayleigh

- Rayleigh procedure brief outline
- Assume an admissible form of the solution with one unknown parameter
- Apply PVD to obtain the best estimate of the exact (but unknown ) solution (e.g. displacement)
- Approximate solution satisfies governing equation (e.g. equilibrium) in an average ( weak) sense.
