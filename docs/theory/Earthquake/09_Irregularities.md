Regular building:

- continuous load path
  - no stress concentrations
  - no diaphragm openings
- low aspect ratio
  - minimal overturning
- equal (regular) story heights
  - consistent story stiffness
- symmetric plan
  - minimal torsion

## Irregularities

- vertical (soft/weak story)
- weight/mass irregularities
- vertical geometric (discontinuous shear walls)

- short/captured columns

### Soft/weak stories

> soft story: stiffness
> weak story: strength

#### Causes

a. Flexible first floor \
b. discontinuity/indirect load path \
c. heavy superstructure \

#### Problems

- large $P-\Delta$ effects
- large rotation demands
- less energy dissipation
- column mechanism; less ductile

#### Approximating Strength

$$V_{wk stry} = \Sigma_i^{stry columns} \operatorname{min}(V_{nc}^i,\frac{\Sigma M_{pr}^i}{h_c^i})$$

$V_{nc}$: column nominal shear capacity

$M_{pr}$: column probable moment strength

#### Retrofitting

- Add columns
- Add bracing
- Add external buttresses

### Setbacks & Planes of Weakness

 creates a kink in mode shape

### Horizontal Irregularities

- **Torsional irregularities** <- focus
- Re-entrant corners
- Diaphragm eccentricity/ cut-outs
- Non-parallel lateral force systems
- Out-of-plane offsets

### Torsional Irregularities

Center of rigidity (COR) $\not ={}$ center of mass (COM)

eccentricity: distance between COM, COR

## Recap

- examples of vertical irregularities
  - offsets in later-load system
  - mass irregularities
  - stiffness irregularities

- examples of horizontal irregularities
  - **Torsional irregularities** <- focus
  - Re-entrant corners
  - Diaphragm eccentricity/ cut-outs
  - Non-parallel lateral load systems
  - Out-of-plane offsets

- What causes torsional irregularities?
  - eccentricity between COM and COR

- Why do short columns perform poorly?
  - small $h$ creates large shear

- Quick strength check for soft story:
