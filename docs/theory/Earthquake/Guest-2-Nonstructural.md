## What are nonstructural components?


## [Why do we care about them?](00:14:49)

Construction cost breakdown:

- Contents $20 \%$
- Nonstructural $60 \%$
- Structure $20\%$

[Lost Estimation](00:16:42)

1. First things damaged in an earthquake
2. Damaged in small earthquakes
3. Can cause loss of life, property loss and business interruption losses
4. Most of the cost of a building is in the nonstructural components and systems
5. Most earthquake losses are nonstructural
6. Seismic protection is required by code
7. A structure is not a building

## [What happens to nonstructural components in EQs?](00:19:20)

Causes of nonstructural damage
- sliding
- rocking
- overturning
- component interaction

[Consequences](00:22:22)

## [Building Code requirements](00:27:00)

### ASCE 7-16

#### [Lateral force](30:31)

$$F_{p}=\frac{0.4 a_{p} S_{D S} W_{p}}{\left[\frac{R_{p}}{I_{p}}\right]}\left[1+2 \frac{z}{h}\right]$$

$a_p$: amplification factor

- measure of component flexibility
- flexible components are like y to resonate with EQ motion
- Refer to table in code.

$W_p$: component weight

$R_p$: ductility

$I_p$: importance/ life safety concern

$z$: component vertical location with respect to building height

$h$: building height

#### Vertical force

$$E_{v}=0.2 S_{D S} W_{p}$$

#### Load combos:

$$\begin{aligned}
&0.9 \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{p}}-0.2 \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{DS}} \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{E}}\\
&0.9 \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{p}}-0.2 \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{DS}} \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{p}}+\Omega_{\mathrm{o}} \mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{E}}
\end{aligned}$$

#### ["Designated seismic systems"](41:55)

Require "Special seismic certification"

### [Post ASCE 7-16](00:46:32)

$$f\left(\mathrm{PGA}, \mathrm{SFRS}, T_{n, b l d g}, \mu_{b l d g}, \beta_{b l d g}, I R R, D I A, \frac{z}{h}, T_{c o m p}, \mu_{c o m p}, \beta_{c o m p}, \Omega_{0 c o m p}\right) \times I_{p}$$

- Ground shaking intensity, $P G A$
- Seismic force-resisting system of the building, SFRS
- The building's modal periods, $T_{n, b l d g}$
- Building ductility, $\mu_{b l d g}$
- Building damping, $\beta_{b l d g}$
- Building configuration (e.g. plan/vertical irregularities), $I R R$

- Floor diaphragm rigidity, $D I A$
- Vertical location of component within the building, z/h 
- Component period, $T_{\text {comp }}$ 
- Component and/or anchorage ductility, $\mu_{\text {comp }}$ 
- Component damping, $\beta_{\text {comp }}$
- Component reserve strength margin, $\Omega_{0 \text { comp }}$

[Proposed Equation](00:51:25)
$$F_{p}=W_{p} \times \operatorname{PGA} \left(\frac{\operatorname{PFA}}{\operatorname{PGA}}\right) \left(\frac{\operatorname{PCA}}{\operatorname{PFA}}\right) \times I_{p}=0.4 S_{D S} I_{p} W_{p}\left[\frac{H_{f}}{R_{\mu}}\right]\left[\frac{C_{A R}}{R_{p o}}\right]$$

- PFA/PGA: Building response
- $R_{\mu bldg}$: Reduction for building ductility
- $R_{pocomp}$: Reduction for component reserve strength.
- PCA/PFA: Component amplification

### Cladding

## Closing

1. Most of the cost of a building is in the nonstructural components and systems
2. Nonstructural components can cause 
   - loss of life, 
   - property loss and 
   - business interruption losses
3. Nonstructural components consideration is an essential part of practicing structural engineering in earthquake country
