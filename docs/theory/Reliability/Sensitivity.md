# Importance

## Importance vector $\hat{\gamma}$

𝜸̂={𝛂̂ 𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}𝐃̃}{‖𝛂̂ 𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}𝐃̃‖}

Since $𝐃̃$ is diagonal with positive elements, the algebraic signs of the elements of $𝛂̂ 𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}𝐃̃$ are the same as those of $𝛂̂ 𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}$. Hence, a positive (negative) value for the element $𝛾̂_𝑖$ of $𝛄̂$ is an indication that the random variable $𝑋̃_𝑖$, or $𝑋_𝑖$, is of demand (capacity) type.

When the random variables 𝐗 are **statistically independent**, $𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}$ is diagonal and $𝐃̃=𝐉_{𝐱,𝐮}$ (see 6.26) so that (6.30) reduces to $𝛄̂=𝛂̂$.

When the random variables have the **Nataf distribution**, 𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}=𝐋_0−1diag[𝑓(𝑥_𝑖)/𝜙(𝑧_𝑖)], where $𝑧_𝑖$ are the intermediate variables (see 3.52). In that case 𝐃̃=diag[𝜙(𝑧𝑖)𝑓(𝑥𝑖)] so that for Nataf-distributed random variables, (6.31) reduces to
𝜸̂=𝛂̂ 𝐋_0^{−1}‖𝜶̂ 𝐋_0^{−1}‖

when the random variables are **jointly normal**, $𝐉_{𝐮,𝐱}=𝐋^{−1}𝐃^{−1}$ and $𝐃̃=𝐃$ so that (6.31) reduces to
𝜸̂=𝛂̂ 𝐋^{−1}‖𝜶̂ 𝐋^{−1}‖
