# Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamics

For an input-output pair $(F(t), X(t)),$ a stable linear system is completely defined by either of the following:

- $h(t)=$ impulse response function (IRF), i.e., response to $F(t)=\delta(t)$
- $H(\omega)=$ frequency response function (FRF), i.e., amplitude of steady-state response to $F(t)=\exp (i \omega t)$

The latter exists only for stable systems, i.e. systems that reach a steady state.

These are related by the Fourier Transformation.
